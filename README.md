OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT:

This project is a Simple Quiz Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application consists of a single question displayed to the user, with three multiple-choice options.
1. **Dynamic Question Display**:
   - The quiz asks: *"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?"* with options for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.

2. **Interactive Answer Selection**:
   - Users can select their answer using radio buttons.

3. **Submit Button Functionality**:
   - A "Submit" button triggers JavaScript to check if the selected answer is correct and displays the result dynamically.

4. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Correct answers display a success message.
   - Incorrect answers prompt users to try again.

5. **User-Friendly Design**:
   - Clean and responsive layout with a white container, rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow for modern styling.
   - The button changes color on hover for better interactivity.
